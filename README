Assignment Specifications:
**************************************************************
Note: It is ok to replicate code found from the Internet. But
when you do so, you have to explicitly mention the site from
where you copied the code. You cannot copy code from other
students, nor can you ask other students about a website from
where they got relevant code from (i.e., You should do the search
yourself and figure out which is the appropriate code for this
assignment).
**************************************************************
In this assignment you will learn to program a basic ftp application using
TCP sockets.

Write a server and a client program using C or C++ and TCP socket such that
a file on the server host is transferred to the client host.

The server program should be started with the following command:
myftp_server <port_no>
where <port_no> is the port on which the server would be listening for
packets from the client.

The client program should be started with the following command:
myftp_client <server_ip> <server_port> <file_name>
where server_ip is the IP address of the host on which the server program
is running and <server_port> is the port on which the
server program is waiting for connections. <file_name> is the file
that should be transferred from the server host to the client host.

If the file does not exist on the server host, an error message
"File <file_name> does not exist" should appear at the client host,
otherwise a message "File succesfully received" should be displayed
on the client after the transfer is over.




Problems faced:

1) The ftp server works very well when tested on localhost
2) IT also works well for files with smaller file sizes over the network
3) It doesnt work well for larger files over the network, we were unable to solve the problem.
